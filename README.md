# 🍏Food Affordability and Dietary Habits Analysis
## 📌Overview
This project explores how food prices, income levels, and eating habits connect in our communities. We analyzed three key datasets to understand:
- How much different foods cost across regions
- What people eat based on their income and age
- How households spend their money on food
## 📂The Data
We worked with three main datasets:
### 1. Food Prices 🛒 
- Contains prices of various foods across different regions from 2012-2018
- Tracks how much people spend on food monthly
### 2. Dietary Habits 🥗
- Survey of 78 people about their eating patterns
- Includes age, gender, diet types, and meal frequencies
### 3. Income and Spending 💰
- Information from 50 households about:
- Monthly income and expenses
- Family size and education levels
## 🔍Key Questions Explored
### 1. How do food prices vary?
- Found that healthy foods (fruits, vegetables) tend to cost more than processed options
- Prices differ significantly by region - some areas pay much more for basics

### 2. What affects eating habits?
- Younger people (18-24) are more likely to skip meals
- Higher-income households eat more vegetables and less processed food
- About 40% of respondents follow some vegetarian diet

### 3. How does income relate to food spending?
- Most households spend about 30-50% of their income on food
- Larger families spend more overall but less per person
- Better education correlates with higher food budgets

## 💡Interesting Findings
* The Healthy Food Gap: Nutritious foods cost 1.5-3× more than processed alternatives
* Age Matters: Young adults (18-24) have the most irregular eating patterns
* Location Impact: Some regions pay 2× more for basics like fruits and vegetables
* Budget Squeeze: Lower-income households spend a bigger portion of their money on food

## 📊How We Analyzed
* Price Comparisons: Calculated average costs for different food types
* Spending Patterns: Tracked how income relates to food expenses
* Diet Trends: Grouped eating habits by age and income level
* Regional Differences: Mapped how prices vary across locations
